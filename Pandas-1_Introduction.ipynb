As well as providing friendlier and more powerful ways of selecting data, Pandas adds a large number of additional functions and methods for various kinds of computations processing data."

Many data scientists, in particular, spend almost all their work during a day reading, processing, and utilizing Pandas DataFrames.  For a certain kind of expert, nearly every task in their daily work is done within Pandas."
